# SpliceVI

Multimodal VAE for joint modeling of alternative splicing (PSI) and gene expression from single-cell data. Built on [scvi-tools](https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools).

---

## Installation

### 1. Create and activate the environment

```bash
conda create -n splicevi-env python=3.12
conda activate splicevi-env
```

### 2. Install the package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daklab/SpliceVI.git
cd SpliceVI
pip install -e .
```

This installs all dependencies automatically from `pyproject.toml`. For W&B logging, additionally run `pip install wandb`.

After installation, `from splicevi import SPLICEVI` works from any script or notebook.

> **Exact environment:** `requirements.txt` contains a full freeze of the development environment for reproducibility reference, but has machine-specific paths and is not intended as a direct install source.

## Usage

Configure paths and hyperparameters at the top of the shell scripts, then submit:

```bash
sbatch train_splicevi.sh
sbatch eval_splicevi.sh
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python train_splicevi.py --help
python eval_splicevi.py --help
```

Future additions:
- [ ] Add `tutorial.ipynb` for a walkthrough of model setup, training, and application to other datasets.
- [ ] Add trained models to Hugging Face
